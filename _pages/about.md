I am a mathematician and data scientist working at RedMane Technology. I develop tools designed to help workers in the health and human services industry.

In August, 2022, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics under the supervision of Steve Zelditch. My thesis is entitled [Empirical Measures for Integrable Eigenfunctions Restricted to Invariant Curves.](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/concern/generic_works/dj52w5081)

My mathematical interests lie in the intersection of geometry, semi-classical analysis, probability, and spectral theory.
